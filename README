Biblio-BF2MARC

Biblio::BF2MARC provides a library to manage conversion of RDF
BIBFRAME 2.0 descriptions into MARC records, using an XSLT 1.0
stylesheet such as the one provided by the bibframe2marc
(https://github.com/lcnetdev/bibframe2marc) project (included in
this distribution as a default). The converter object is built on an
RDF::Trine::Model, and so can operate on RDF graphs in memory, from a
file, or from any storage backend supported by RDF::Trine::Store. The
converter returns MARCXML as XML::LibXML objects, which can in turn be
converted into MARC::Record objects to support alternate MARC
serializations.
